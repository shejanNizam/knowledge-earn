      <h1>Questions-1: Difference between props vs state??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: The difference comes in which component the data are owned. The
        state is owned locally, and the component itself updates it. Props are
        owned and read only by a parent. Props can be changed only if an
        upstream shift is caused by a callback function passed on to the child.

      <h1>Questions-3: Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: The useEffect in react js allows you to perform side effects in
        your components. The react useEffect examples of side effects include
        retrieving data, direct DOM updates, and timers. The second argument is
        optional.

      <h1>Questions-4: How Does React work??</h1>
      <p>
        Answer: ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code
        known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript
        functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.
        It's possible to have as many components as necessary without cluttering
        your code.
